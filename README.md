# About firepig2019:
A repository for all parts of the course "Human-Computer interaction".

## About the last task:
There are two labs:
1. Detailed prototype (the one with colours and input, such as text, simulation). Team: Vilius and Manfredas.
2. Prototype's usability testing. Team: Tomas, Teodoras and Edvinas.

## Questions for the lecturer:
1. Do we need to make only one prototype? - Yes one and only. It will be the one that will be tested.
2. There is a requirement to have 5 users test your prototype. If two users partake in the same testing session, do we count them both in the sum? - They both count.
