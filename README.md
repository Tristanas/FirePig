# About firepig2019:
A repository for all parts of the course "Human-Computer interaction".

## About the last task:
There are two labs:
1. Detailed prototype (the one with colours and input, such as text, simulation).
2. Prototype's usability testing.
We need to divide our efforts. Choose, who does the detailed prototype and who tests the usability.

## Questions for the lecturer:
1. Do we need to make only one prototype?
2. There is a requirement to have 5 users test your prototype. If two users partake in the same testing session, do we count them both in the sum?
